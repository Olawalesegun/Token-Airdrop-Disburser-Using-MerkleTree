# Merkle Airdrop Project

Welcome to the Merkle Airdrop Project! This guide will walk you through setting up and running the `merkle.js` script, deploying the `MerkleAirdrop` smart contract, and generating proofs for claiming airdrops. We'll also cover some assumptions and limitations of the implementation.

## Setting Up and Running `merkle.js`

To begin, ensure you have Node.js (version 18.x or later) installed on your system. This project relies on several Node.js modules, so you'll need to install them first.

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    
    Start by cloning the project repository to your local machine:
    
  ```
	  git clone https://github.com/Olawalesegun/Token-Airdrop-Disburser-Using-MerkleTree
	  cd contracts/merkle-airdrop
